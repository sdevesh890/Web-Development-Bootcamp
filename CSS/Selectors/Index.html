        <h1 id="heading1">The Top 10 IDEs for Programmers: A Comprehensive Guide <br> to Choosing the Best IDE For Your Needs</h1>

        <h2>What’s an IDE and how does it help programmers?</h2>
        <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides programmers with a thorough set of tools to create and deploy software applications.

            Developers use IDEs to write, edit, compile, test and debug code in one place. By combining all the necessary components into one toolset, IDEs help reduce the time it takes for programmers to develop software applications.</p>
